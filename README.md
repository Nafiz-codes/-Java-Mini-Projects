# 🎮 Java Mini Projects 
Built by Nafiz Shahriar  

Two classic games/tools, reimagined in Java:  
- ✏️ **Hangman** – a word guessing battle against the gallows  
- 🎵 **Music Player** – a retro-style console jukebox for your `.wav` tracks  

Both are simple, fun, and straight from the terminal.

## ✏️ Hangman – The Word Duel  
Guess the word before the hangman meets his doom.  

“Wrong guess? Say hello to a stickman with one more limb. Six strikes and you’re out.”  

### 🧠 Features
- Loads words from a `words.txt` file  
- ASCII art hangman that evolves with each wrong guess  
- Win/lose messages that keep it old-school  

---

## 🎵 Music Player – Console Jukebox  
A minimal `.wav` music player built with Java’s `javax.sound.sampled`.  

“Think of it as a cassette player for your terminal. No shuffle, no Spotify AI — just raw play, stop, reset.”  

### 🧠 Features
- Plays `.wav` files from your local machine  
- Simple commands:  
  - `P` → Play  
  - `S` → Stop  
  - `R` → Reset  
  - `Q` → Quit

## 🛠️ Behind the Scenes
These projects were made to sharpen my Java skills and keep things **fun + practical**:  
- Learned file handling with `BufferedReader` (Hangman’s word list)  
- Experimented with audio streams and `Clip` objects in Java  
- Designed CLI menus that feel interactive even without a GUI

## 👤 Created By
**Nafiz Shahriar** — Just a guy who wanted to build cool little tools while learning Java.  

“I wanted Hangman to feel like those childhood paper games, and the Music Player like an old cassette deck in the terminal.”
